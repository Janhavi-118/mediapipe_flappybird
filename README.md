# mediapipe_flappybird
This repository allows you to play the flappy bird game using the hand coordinates of your right hand. It uses mediapipe for detecting the coordinates of the arm and the hand, OpenCV for the live video capture, and pygame for the Flappy Bird game to run.

To play, make sure that your right hand from soulder to hand is in the frame and your hand is straight.

To run the program, run the main.py file.
